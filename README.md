##To do list:
1. Logging support, maybe log4j? Make it work with `WebDriverEventListener`
2. Reports with screenshots on failed test, ExtentReports or Allure?
3. Environment parametrization, external file with configuration?
4. Implement some test listener to make keeping tabs on tests status cleaner
5. Docker and Selenium Grid support
6. Jenkins support
